# Now it is time to create your own data frame using the tools we have learned this week.
# First, resave this script as: yourlastname_Week1_Assignment [6 point]
  # e.g. mine would be Wilson_Week1_Assignment


# Create 3 numeric vectors and 2 character vectors that are each 15 values in length with the following structures: [10 points; 2 each]
  # One character vector with all unique values
  # One character vector with exactly 3 unique values
  # One numeric vector with all unique values
  # One numeric vector with some repeated values (number of your choosing)
  # One numeric vector with some decimal values (of your choosing)

#Creating Vectors#

#Use "c" function and same number of values for each vector
# Remember to use "" when using text

#Create and Organize Data Frame#
  
# Bind the vectors into a single data frame, rename the columns, and make the character vector with unique values the row names.[3 points]

#Adding and Removing Data from the Data Frame#

# Remove the character vector with unique values from the data frame.[2 points]

df <- df[,-1]
df

# Add 1 row with unique numeric values to the data frame.[2 points]
#Breakdown of steps:
#1:Make new data frame consisting of new row
#2:Make the column names of new df to be the same as old df
#3:Combine using rbind 
#4 Align rows/columns

Years <- data.frame(1945,1946,1947,1948)

df.b

# Export the data frame as a .csv file [2 points]

setwd("C:/GitHub/hornam/Week1")
getwd()
writecsv(df.b, file="HW1df.csv")

# Generate summary statistics of your data frame and copy them as text into your script under a new section heading. [2 points]

# Push your script and your .csv file to GitHub in a new "Week1" folder you have created in your repository. [3 points]
